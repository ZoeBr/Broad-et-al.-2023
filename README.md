# Data Availability
Gene expression sequencing data files are available on The University of Queensland Research Data Manager repository. The data files generated at each step of this process are also available.

# Bioinformatics
Gene expression sequencing was conducted by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) using the DNBseq platform. Pooled samples were sequenced randomly with respect to Gravitropic/Agravitropic phenotype, control and rotation group and time group (Samples were taken at 5 time points). 

## Quality filtering
Basic quality control of the FASTq files was conducted using FASTQC (SOURCE) on default parameters.

A report for all individuals was compiled from the FASTQC outputs using MultiQC (SOURCE).
